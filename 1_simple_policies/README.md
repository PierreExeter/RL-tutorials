# Introduction to OpenAI Gym

![cartpole](images/cartpole.gif)

This is an introduction to the OpenAI Gym library. This library can initialise virtual environments that can be used to train reinforcement learning agents.

In these example, the cartpole-v0 environment is initialised and some simple policies (random and hardcoded) are defined and applied to the problem.

Please refer to [this article](https://www.datasparked.com/reinforcement%20learning/Introduction-to-openAI-gym/) for more information.


# Installation

```bash
pip install gym
```

# Run the code

```bash
